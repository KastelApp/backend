# **Info**

These are just some tidbits of info for stuff like Flags and other things!

# **Guilds**

## **Guild Flags**

### **Official Flag**

The Official Flag is given to Guilds owned out right by Kastel, These can include the Developer Support guild, The Normal Support guild and more. This is **NOT** like the Verified Flag, The verified flag can and will be given to Guilds from companies or Big bots to prove they are the real deal.

### **No Owner Flag**

The No Owner flag is given to a guild when a owner of the guild has been banned, The User data has been wiped By A) Them deleting their account or B) deletion due to breaking the tos or a law. etc.

Co-Owners will be able to contact support to try and re-claim the guild as long as a few things are checked.

If No Co-Owners are in the guild then any Admin is able to try and re-claim the guild though theres a low chance.

**30 Days after the flag is added, If no attempt has been made to re-claim the guild it will be deleted.**

# **Channels**

## **Channel Types**

### **New Member**

The New Member channel is a Special channel users with the MANAGE_CHANNELS permission can make on a guild, This channel unlike others can be set to only be viewed for a certain amount of time after a member joins the guild, This can be from 1 hour all the way up to 7 days.

Only New Members and users with the MANAGE_CHANNELS permission can see the channel. It acts like a normal channel in every other way.

# **Invites**

## **Never Expires**

A Never expiring Invite is not really a thing in Kastel, We have it where after 3 months a invite expires. Though this will be changed at a later point to actually allow for never ending invites as it is now we do not support them. Please check back soon though
